Day 1 Quiz
----------
1. List some of the characteristics of Python.
Object-oriented.
Interpreted (no compile stage)
Easy to learn and use (because its syntax is declarative)
High-level programming (we don't have to worry what systems it runs on)
Open source, free to use
Dynamically-typed (takes variable type from value, and can change over time)
Named after Monty Python

2. The Python interpreter can be executed in two ways. What are they?
script mode
interactive

3. How should variables and functions be named in Python?
snake_case (lower case underscore separated)
not starting with numbers or specials
no reserved words
meaningfully - clear wording


4. What does a variable contain/reference, and how should it (almost) always be declared?
it should be initialised when declared (because there is no keyword, and it takes its initial type from initial value)
(you have to have something on the RHS of =)
<a reference> = <a value>

5. Describe each part of the following statement:

x = 12

x is named as a variable
if variable with that name already exists then it is re-assigned using =
if immutable value on RHS already exists then it is reassigned using = to current reference
= is assignment operator, assigns R-L direction
12 is an int type, or integer literal

6. List 5 of the fundamental data types.
int, 
float, 
str, 
bool, 
list[], 
tuple(), 
dict{"key": "value", "key2": "value"} - keys may not be duplicated but values may, 
set{} - individual values, may not contain duplicates
None
complex - used a lot in electrical engineering
- if you want to find a sqrt of a negative number, say sqrt of -4,
- 2i (i means whole square root of -1) because -2 * -2 yields a positive - you'll never get a minus number
- i used typically to reference current, in amps

7. How does one read from a list element?
with indices
my_list = [1,2,3]
get the third number:
my_list[2]

8. Name TWO falsey values (values that will convert to False when passed to a bool() wrapper function):
empty containers
0

9. What value does the number 1 become when passed to a float() wrapper function?
1.0

10. What value does the string value "Hello" become when passed to a bool() wrapper function?
True
even " " is true (space character)
only empty string "" is false
