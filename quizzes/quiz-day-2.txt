Day 2 Quiz
----------

1. What is a for loop best suited to do?
To execute a code block each time, for a known/specific amount of iterations

2. What is a while loop best suited for?
When the number of iterations is not known or unlimited

3. When will an optional else clause after a loop run? (any loop, for or while)
After the loop has completed its last iteration - no break encountered

4. In a function definition, what syntax denotes 
the block of code that is the body of the function?
:
indent  

5. What is the keyword required to exit from this loop:

while True:
    # some code
    break

6. Differentiate between a module and a script.
A module contains functions (and classes)
A script contains code that calls those functions (and classes)
functions made available via import statements - TODO

7. If we see the following line in a module, under what circumstances will the code below be executed?

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # code will run if the containing module is run 
    # but NOT if we import to another script

8. If a function has a return statement, can any code come after that line?
it can, but will be unreachable
having said that, there may be more tahn one return in a functionbut if so, each return will be the very last LOC in that specific PATH THROUGH the function
often called the HAPPY PATH / SAD PATH

9. If a function has input, what is this called at function definition time?
parameters

10. If a function has input, what is this called at runtime?
arguments

11. BONUS QUESTION: What, if anything, do we know in Python about the datatypes of the parameters to a function?
NOTHING
They are not defined UNTIL passed in - used in function
TODO: type hinting - non-enforceable
