# variable declaration
#in python, there is no key word to declare a variable apart from a couple of edge cases
#This means a python varibale must be initialised with a varibale when forst declared.
my_variable = 1 #declared and assigned a value 1 to my variable
my_name = "Lewis"
print(type(my_variable))
print(type(my_name))
your_name = input ("Enter your name:")
print(your_name)
