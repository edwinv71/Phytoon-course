#In this exercise you will create a number guess game. It will prompt the user to guess the
#magic number between 1 and 10. If the user guesses correctly, it will print a winner
#message and exit. If the user guesses incorrectly, he/she will be prompted again. The user
#will be given three go's after which, if he/she has not guessed correctly the script will
#print a loser message.
#1. Create a script named loops_exercise.py.
#2. Import the random module as follows:import random
#3. Declare and assign a variable that produces a random number in the range 1-10, as follows:
# magic_number = random.randint(1, 10)
#4. Code a loop that iterates three times.
#5. Inside the loopâ€¦
#a. Prompt the user to input a guess and capture it in a variable named
#user_guess.
#b. If the user's guess equals the magic number, print a winner message to the
#console and break out of the loop.
#c. If the user's guess does not equal the magic number, print an appropriate
#message, e.g. too low or too high.
#6. If the loop exits normally, the user has not guessed correctly so print a suitable
#consolation message to the console.
import random
magic_number = random.randint(1, 10)
counter=1

while counter <=3:
    your_magic_number=input("INPUT YOUR MAGIC NUMBER BETWEEN 1 AND 10:")
    user_guess=int(your_magic_number)
    counter+=1

    if user_guess == magic_number:
        print("Winner")
        break
    elif user_guess>magic_number:
        print("too high")
    elif user_guess<magic_number:
        print("too low")
    else:
        print("Try again!")
if user_guess != magic_number:
    print(f"The number was {magic_number}. You were close")
